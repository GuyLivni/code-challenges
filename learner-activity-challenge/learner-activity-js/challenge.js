  /*  ***** INSTRUCTIONS ***** 
We want to get some learning activity data of our learners! 
You will receive an array as an input, containing 1s or 0s, based on whether or not a learner completed a 
lesson on that day (1 if they completed a lesson, 0 if not). 

Assume that the array can be for any time period, but the learner status is based on a 
rolling 7 day period (thus only take into account the last 7 daysâ€™ data).

  Return an array containing 3 values:
  1. number of days that the user completed a lesson
  2. longest streak
  3. level based on the last 7 days

    User status rules
  <= 2 'Slow starter' 
  >2 && <= 4 'Getting there' 
  >4 'Super user' 

  Instructions
  run npm install to ensure that you install Jest, the test framework
  if you want to test you code, run 'npm test' from the console and look at the console output to see if your tests passed
  to ensure your solution is smaller than 4MB please delete your node_modules before uploading your solution 

    Example input
   [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0]

  Example output
  [13, 5, 'Super user']
